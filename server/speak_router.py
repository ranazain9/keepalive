"""POST /speak as a FastAPI router: agent text → safety gate → the app's voice → PCM stream.

Drop it into any FastAPI app:

    from speak_router import SARAH, make_speak_router
    app.include_router(make_speak_router(api_key=os.environ["ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"], **SARAH))

The response is raw little-endian PCM16, 24 kHz, mono (`application/octet-stream`);
the browser plays it with `audio.playPcmResponse(res)`. The ElevenLabs key never
leaves the server. One pooled HTTPS connection to ElevenLabs is kept warm, so an
answer skips the TCP + TLS handshake (median 244 → 141 ms, measured Sep 17).
